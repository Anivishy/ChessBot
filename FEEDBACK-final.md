# Final feedback

## Overall score: 10/10

You managed to complete the baseline of having a working chess program (yay!)
complete with reasonable heuristics. I'm glad you were able to experiment with
machine learning and think through how to tailor the game to specific players,
but completing that project was always going to be hard. Hopefully you've
learned enough in the process that some of you will be able to finish it as a
PhD thesis!

## Specific callouts

* Ani and Rushil, if I'm reading the logs correctly, it looks like you did a
  prodigious amount of coding!
* Ankit, it looks like you did a bunch of ML work, but never opened a PR for
  it? So you know for the future, in a work place you only get credit for
  things you actually manage to land in main.
* Teja, it looks like a lot of your code never landed in main? Also, a future
  goal for you is to curate your commits to avoid extraneous merges and git
  entries.
* Later note: ah, Teja, I see you submitted a PR on Sunday evening.
